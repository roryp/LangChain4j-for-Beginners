## What You'll Learn

You've built conversational AI, mastered prompts, grounded responses in documents, and created agents with tools. But all those tools were custom-built for your specific application. What if you could give your AI access to a standardized ecosystem of tools that anyone can create and share?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides exactly that - a standard way for AI applications to discover and use external tools. Instead of writing custom integrations for each data source or service, you connect to MCP servers that expose their capabilities in a consistent format. Your AI agent can then discover and use these tools automatically.

In this module, you'll learn:

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** - A standard way for AI applications to discover and use external tools
- **MCP Transports** - How to connect to MCP servers using Stdio for local processes
- **Tool Discovery** - How AI agents automatically discover and use available tools
- **Agentic Module** - Build declarative agents using `@Agent` annotations and `AgenticServices` - the modern approach to creating AI agents that can leverage MCP tools

*Before MCP: Complex point-to-point integrations. After MCP: One protocol, endless possibilities.*

## Understanding MCP

MCP solves a fundamental problem in AI development: every integration is custom. Want to access GitHub? Custom code. Want to read files? Custom code. Want to query a database? Custom code. And none of these integrations work with other AI applications.

MCP standardizes this. An MCP server exposes tools with clear descriptions and schemas. Any MCP client can connect, discover available tools, and use them. Build once, use everywhere.

*Model Context Protocol architecture - standardized tool discovery and execution*

## How MCP Works

**Server-Client Architecture**

MCP uses a client-server model. Servers provide tools - reading files, querying databases, calling APIs. Clients (your AI application) connect to servers and use their tools.

To use MCP with LangChain4j, add this Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.langchain4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>langchain4j-mcp</artifactId>
    <version>${langchain4j.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

**Tool Discovery**

When your client connects to an MCP server, it asks "What tools do you have?" The server responds with a list of available tools, each with descriptions and parameter schemas. Your AI agent can then decide which tools to use based on user requests.

**Transport Mechanisms**

MCP supports different transport mechanisms. This module demonstrates the Stdio transport for local processes:

<img src="images/transport-mechanisms.png" alt="Transport Mechanisms" width="800"/>

*MCP transport mechanisms: HTTP for remote servers, Stdio for local processes*

**Stdio** - [StdioTransportDemo.java](src/main/java/com/example/langchain4j/mcp/StdioTransportDemo.java)

For local processes. Your application spawns a server as a subprocess and communicates through standard input/output. Useful for filesystem access or command-line tools.

```java
McpTransport stdioTransport = new StdioMcpTransport.Builder()
    .command(List.of(
        npmCmd, "exec",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem@2025.12.18",
        resourcesDir
    ))
    .logEvents(false)
    .build();
```

> - "How does LangChain4j manage the lifecycle of spawned MCP server processes?"
> - "What are the security implications of giving AI access to the file system?"

## The Agentic Module

While MCP provides standardized tools, LangChain4j's **agentic module** provides a declarative way to build agents that orchestrate those tools. The `@Agent` annotation and `AgenticServices` let you define agent behavior through interfaces rather than imperative code.

In this module, you'll explore the **Supervisor Agent** pattern — an advanced agentic AI approach where a "supervisor" agent dynamically decides which sub-agents to invoke based on user requests. We'll combine both concepts by giving one of our sub-agents MCP-powered file access capabilities.

To use the agentic module, add this Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.langchain4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>langchain4j-agentic</artifactId>
    <version>${langchain4j.mcp.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

> **⚠️ Experimental:** The `langchain4j-agentic` module is **experimental** and subject to change. The stable way to build AI assistants remains `langchain4j-core` with custom tools (Module 04).

## Running the Examples

### Prerequisites

- Java 21+, Maven 3.9+
- Node.js 16+ and npm (for MCP servers)
- GitHub Personal Access Token configured in `.env` file (from Module 00)

> **Note:** If you haven't set up your GitHub token yet, see [Module 00 - Quick Start](../00-quick-start/README.md) for instructions.

## Quick Start

**Using VS Code:** Simply right-click on any demo file in the Explorer and select **"Run Java"**, or use the launch configurations from the Run and Debug panel (make sure you've added your token to the `.env` file first).

**Using Maven:** Alternatively, you can run from the command line with the examples below.

### File Operations (Stdio)

This demonstrates local subprocess-based tools.

**✅ No prerequisites needed** - the MCP server is spawned automatically.

**Using VS Code:** Right-click on `StdioTransportDemo.java` and select **"Run Java"**.

**Using Maven:**

**Bash:**
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
cd 05-mcp
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.example.langchain4j.mcp.StdioTransportDemo
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
cd 05-mcp
mvn --% compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.example.langchain4j.mcp.StdioTransportDemo
```

The application spawns a filesystem MCP server automatically and reads a local file. Notice how the subprocess management is handled for you.

**Expected output:**
```
Assistant response: The file provides an overview of LangChain4j, an open-source Java library
for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into Java applications...
```

### Supervisor Agent (Pure Agentic AI)

The **Supervisor Agent** pattern is the most flexible form of agentic AI. Unlike deterministic workflows (sequential, loop, parallel), a Supervisor uses an LLM to autonomously decide which agents to invoke based on the user's request.

**Key concepts:**
- The Supervisor analyzes the user request and generates an execution plan
- It decides which sub-agents to invoke and in what order
- It can adapt dynamically to different types of requests
- Returns either the last agent's response or a summary of all operations

**Using VS Code:** Right-click on `SupervisorAgentDemo.java` and select **"Run Java"**.

**Using Maven:**

**Bash:**
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
cd 05-mcp
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.example.langchain4j.mcp.SupervisorAgentDemo
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
cd 05-mcp
mvn --% compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.example.langchain4j.mcp.SupervisorAgentDemo
```

**How the Supervisor Works:**

```java
// Define multiple agents with specific capabilities
FileAgent fileAgent = AgenticServices.agentBuilder(FileAgent.class)
        .chatModel(model)
        .toolProvider(mcpToolProvider)  // Has MCP tools for file operations
        .build();

AnalysisAgent analysisAgent = AgenticServices.agentBuilder(AnalysisAgent.class)
        .chatModel(model)
        .build();

SummaryAgent summaryAgent = AgenticServices.agentBuilder(SummaryAgent.class)
        .chatModel(model)
        .build();

// Create a Supervisor that orchestrates these agents
SupervisorAgent supervisor = AgenticServices.supervisorBuilder()
        .chatModel(model)  // The "planner" model
        .subAgents(fileAgent, analysisAgent, summaryAgent)
        .responseStrategy(SupervisorResponseStrategy.SUMMARY)
        .build();

// The Supervisor autonomously decides which agents to invoke
// Just pass a natural language request - the LLM plans the execution
String response = supervisor.invoke("Read the file at /path/file.txt and analyze it");
```

See [SupervisorAgentDemo.java](src/main/java/com/example/langchain4j/mcp/SupervisorAgentDemo.java) for the complete implementation.

> - "What's the difference between Supervisor and Sequential workflow patterns?"
> - "How can I customize the Supervisor's planning behavior?"

**Expected output:**
```

### Other Agentic Module Features

Beyond the Supervisor pattern, the `langchain4j-agentic` module provides several powerful workflow patterns and features:

| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Sequential** | Execute agents in order, output flows to next | Pipelines: research → analyze → report |
| **Parallel** | Run agents simultaneously | Independent tasks: weather + news + stocks |
| **Loop** | Iterate until condition met | Quality scoring: refine until score ≥ 0.8 |
| **Conditional** | Route based on conditions | Classify → route to specialist agent |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | Add human checkpoints | Approval workflows, content review |

**AgenticScope** allows agents to share state and introspect execution:

```java
ResultWithAgenticScope<String> result = supervisor.invokeWithAgenticScope(request);
AgenticScope scope = result.agenticScope();
String story = scope.readState("story");
List<AgentInvocation> history = scope.agentInvocations("analysisAgent");
```

**Agent Listeners** enable monitoring and debugging:

```java
AgentListener monitor = new AgentListener() {
    @Override
    public void onAgentInvoked(AgentInvocation invocation) {
        System.out.println("Agent: " + invocation.agentName() + ", Duration: " + invocation.duration());
    }
};
```

## Key Concepts

**Use MCP when:**
- You want to leverage existing tool ecosystems
- Building tools that multiple applications will use
- Integrating third-party services with standard protocols
- You need to swap tool implementations without code changes

**Use the Agentic Module when:**
- You want declarative agent definitions with `@Agent` annotations
- Building agents that need workflow orchestration (sequential, loop, parallel)
- You prefer interface-based agent design over imperative code
- Combining multiple agents that can share outputs via `outputKey`

**Use the Supervisor Agent pattern when:**
- The workflow isn't predictable in advance - let the LLM decide
- You have multiple specialized agents and want dynamic orchestration
- Building conversational systems that need to route to different capabilities
- You want the most flexible, adaptive agent behavior

## Troubleshooting

### PowerShell Maven Command Syntax

**Issue**: Maven commands fail with error `Unknown lifecycle phase ".mainClass=..."`

**Cause**: PowerShell interprets `=` as a variable assignment operator, breaking Maven property syntax

**Solution**: Use the stop-parsing operator `--%` before the Maven command:

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
mvn --% compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.example.langchain4j.mcp.StdioTransportDemo
```

**Bash:**
```bash
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.example.langchain4j.mcp.StdioTransportDemo
```

The `--%` operator tells PowerShell to pass all remaining arguments literally to Maven without interpretation.
