LangChain4j is an open-source Java library that simplifies the integration of LLMs into Java applications through a unified API, providing access to popular LLMs and vector databases. It makes implementing RAG, tool calling (including support for MCP), and agents easy. LangChain4j integrates seamlessly with various enterprise Java frameworks.

The goal of LangChain4j is to simplify integrating LLMs into Java applications.

Unified APIs: LLM providers (like OpenAI or Google Vertex AI) and embedding (vector) stores (such as Pinecone or Milvus) use proprietary APIs. LangChain4j offers a unified API to avoid the need for learning and implementing specific APIs for each of them. To experiment with different LLMs or embedding stores, developers can easily switch between them without the need to rewrite code. LangChain4j currently supports 20+ popular LLM providers and 30+ embedding stores.

Comprehensive Toolbox: Since early 2023, the community has been building numerous LLM-powered applications, identifying common abstractions, patterns, and techniques. LangChain4j has refined these into practical code. The toolbox includes tools ranging from low-level prompt templating, chat memory management, and function calling to high-level patterns like Agents and RAG. For each abstraction, an interface is provided along with multiple ready-to-use implementations based on common techniques. Whether building a chatbot or developing a RAG with a complete pipeline from data ingestion to retrieval, LangChain4j offers a wide variety of options.

Numerous Examples: These examples showcase how to begin creating various LLM-powered applications, providing inspiration and enabling developers to start building quickly.

LangChain4j began development in early 2023 amid the ChatGPT hype. The team noticed a lack of Java counterparts to the numerous Python and JavaScript LLM libraries and frameworks, and they had to fix that! Although "LangChain" is in the name, the project is a fusion of ideas and concepts from LangChain, Haystack, LlamaIndex, and the broader community, spiced up with a touch of innovation.

The team actively monitors community developments, aiming to quickly incorporate new techniques and integrations, ensuring users stay up-to-date. The library is under active development. While some features are still being worked on, the core functionality is in place, allowing developers to start building LLM-powered apps now!
