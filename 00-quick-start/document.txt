LangChain4j - Java Framework for AI Applications

LangChain4j is a comprehensive Java library designed to simplify the development of AI-powered applications. It provides a unified interface for working with various Large Language Model (LLM) providers, making it easy to integrate AI capabilities into Java applications.

Key Features:
- Multi-Provider Support: Works with OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, and many other AI providers
- Chat Models: Support for both synchronous and streaming chat completions
- Embeddings: Convert text to vector representations for semantic search
- Function Calling: Enable AI models to call Java methods and tools
- Memory Management: Built-in conversation history and context management
- RAG Support: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with vector stores
- Document Processing: Load and process various document formats

Architecture:
LangChain4j follows a modular architecture with separate modules for different providers and capabilities. The core library provides abstractions and interfaces, while provider-specific modules implement these interfaces for different AI services.

Use Cases:
- Chatbots and conversational interfaces
- Document question-answering systems
- Code generation and analysis
- Content summarization
- Semantic search applications
- AI-powered data extraction

Getting Started:
To use LangChain4j, add the core dependency and a provider-specific module to your Maven or Gradle project. Then configure the model with your API credentials and start building AI-powered features.

GitHub Models Integration:
LangChain4j works seamlessly with GitHub Models through its OpenAI-compatible interface. This provides free access to state-of-the-art models for learning and development purposes without requiring an Azure subscription.
