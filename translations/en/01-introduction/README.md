## What You'll Learn

If you completed the quick start, you saw how to send prompts and get responses. That's the foundation, but real applications need more. This module teaches you how to build conversational AI that remembers context and maintains state - the difference between a one-off demo and a production-ready application.

We'll use Azure OpenAI's GPT-5 throughout this guide because its advanced reasoning capabilities make the behavior of different patterns more apparent. When you add memory, you'll clearly see the difference. This makes it easier to understand what each component brings to your application.

You'll build one application that demonstrates both patterns:

**Stateless Chat** - Each request is independent. The model has no memory of previous messages. This is the pattern you used in the quick start.

**Stateful Conversation** - Each request includes conversation history. The model maintains context across multiple turns. This is what production applications require.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription with Azure OpenAI access
- Java 21, Maven 3.9+ 
- Azure CLI (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- Azure Developer CLI (azd) (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)

> **Note:** Java, Maven, Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI (azd) are pre-installed in the provided devcontainer.

> **Note:** This module uses GPT-5 on Azure OpenAI. The deployment is configured automatically via `azd up` - do not modify the model name in the code.

## Understanding the Core Problem

Language models are stateless. Each API call is independent. If you send "My name is John" and then ask "What's my name?", the model has no idea you just introduced yourself. It treats every request as if it's the first conversation you've ever had.

This is fine for simple Q&A but useless for real applications. Customer service bots need to remember what you told them. Personal assistants need context. Any multi-turn conversation requires memory.

## Understanding Tokens

Before diving into conversations, it's important to understand tokens - the basic units of text that language models process:

<img src="../../../translated_images/en/token-explanation.c39760d8ec650181.webp" alt="Token Explanation" width="800"/>

*Example of how text is broken into tokens - "I love AI!" becomes 4 separate processing units*

Tokens are how AI models measure and process text. Words, punctuation, and even spaces can be tokens. Your model has a limit of how many tokens it can process at once (400,000 for GPT-5, with up to 272,000 input tokens and 128,000 output tokens). Understanding tokens helps you manage conversation length and costs.

## How Memory Works

Chat memory solves the stateless problem by maintaining conversation history. Before sending your request to the model, the framework prepends relevant previous messages. When you ask "What's my name?", the system actually sends the entire conversation history, allowing the model to see you previously said "My name is John."

LangChain4j provides memory implementations that handle this automatically. You choose how many messages to retain and the framework manages the context window.

*MessageWindowChatMemory maintains a sliding window of recent messages, automatically dropping old ones*

## How This Uses LangChain4j

This module extends the quick start by integrating Spring Boot and adding conversation memory. Here's how the pieces fit together:

**Dependencies** - Add two LangChain4j libraries:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.langchain4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>langchain4j</artifactId> <!-- Inherited from BOM in root pom.xml -->
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.langchain4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>langchain4j-open-ai-official</artifactId> <!-- Inherited from BOM in root pom.xml -->
</dependency>
```

**Chat Model** - Configure Azure OpenAI as a Spring bean ([LangChainConfig.java](../../../01-introduction/src/main/java/com/example/langchain4j/config/LangChainConfig.java)):

```java
@Bean
public OpenAiOfficialChatModel openAiOfficialChatModel() {
    return OpenAiOfficialChatModel.builder()
            .baseUrl(azureEndpoint)
            .apiKey(azureApiKey)
            .modelName(deploymentName)
            .timeout(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
            .maxRetries(3)
            .build();
}
```

The builder reads credentials from environment variables set by `azd up`. Setting `baseUrl` to your Azure endpoint makes the OpenAI client work with Azure OpenAI.

**Conversation Memory** - Track chat history with MessageWindowChatMemory ([ConversationService.java](../../../01-introduction/src/main/java/com/example/langchain4j/service/ConversationService.java)):

```java
ChatMemory memory = MessageWindowChatMemory.withMaxMessages(10);

memory.add(UserMessage.from("My name is John"));
memory.add(AiMessage.from("Nice to meet you, John!"));

memory.add(UserMessage.from("What's my name?"));
AiMessage aiMessage = chatModel.chat(memory.messages()).aiMessage();
memory.add(aiMessage);
```

Create memory with `withMaxMessages(10)` to keep the last 10 messages. Add user and AI messages with typed wrappers: `UserMessage.from(text)` and `AiMessage.from(text)`. Retrieve history with `memory.messages()` and send it to the model. The service stores separate memory instances per conversation ID, allowing multiple users to chat simultaneously.

> **🤖 Try with [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) Chat:** Open [`ConversationService.java`](../../../01-introduction/src/main/java/com/example/langchain4j/service/ConversationService.java) and ask:
> - "How does MessageWindowChatMemory decide which messages to drop when the window is full?"
> - "Can I implement custom memory storage using a database instead of in-memory?"
> - "How would I add summarization to compress old conversation history?"

The stateless chat endpoint skips memory entirely - just `chatModel.chat(prompt)` like the quick start. The stateful endpoint adds messages to memory, retrieves history, and includes that context with each request. Same model configuration, different patterns.

## Deploy Azure OpenAI Infrastructure

**Bash:**
```bash
cd 01-introduction
azd up  # Select subscription and location (eastus2 recommended)
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
cd 01-introduction
azd up  # Select subscription and location (eastus2 recommended)
```

> **Note:** If you encounter a timeout error (`RequestConflict: Cannot modify resource ... provisioning state is not terminal`), simply run `azd up` again. Azure resources may still be provisioning in the background, and retrying allows the deployment to complete once resources reach a terminal state.

This will:
1. Deploy Azure OpenAI resource with GPT-5 and text-embedding-3-small models
2. Automatically generate `.env` file in project root with credentials
3. Set up all required environment variables

**Having deployment issues?** See the [Infrastructure README](infra/README.md) for detailed troubleshooting including subdomain name conflicts, manual Azure Portal deployment steps, and model configuration guidance.

**Verify deployment succeeded:**

**Bash:**
```bash
cat ../.env  # Should show AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT, API_KEY, etc.
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
Get-Content ..\.env  # Should show AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT, API_KEY, etc.
```

> **Note:** The `azd up` command automatically generates the `.env` file. If you need to update it later, you can either edit the `.env` file manually or regenerate it by running:
>
> **Bash:**
> ```bash
> cd ..
> bash .azd-env.sh
> ```
>
> **PowerShell:**
> ```powershell
> cd ..
> .\.azd-env.ps1
> ```

## Run the Application Locally

**Verify deployment:**

Ensure the `.env` file exists in root directory with Azure credentials:

**Bash:**
```bash
cat ../.env  # Should show AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT, API_KEY, DEPLOYMENT
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
Get-Content ..\.env  # Should show AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT, API_KEY, DEPLOYMENT
```

**Start the applications:**

**Option 1: Using Spring Boot Dashboard (Recommended for VS Code users)**

The dev container includes the Spring Boot Dashboard extension, which provides a visual interface to manage all Spring Boot applications. You can find it in the Activity Bar on the left side of VS Code (look for the Spring Boot icon).

From the Spring Boot Dashboard, you can:
- See all available Spring Boot applications in the workspace
- Start/stop applications with a single click
- View application logs in real-time
- Monitor application status

Simply click the play button next to "introduction" to start this module, or start all modules at once.

<img src="../../../translated_images/en/dashboard.69c7479aef09ff6b.webp" alt="Spring Boot Dashboard" width="400"/>

**Option 2: Using shell scripts**

Start all web applications (modules 01-04):

**Bash:**
```bash
cd ..  # From root directory
./start-all.sh
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
cd ..  # From root directory
.\start-all.ps1
```

Or start just this module:

**Bash:**
```bash
cd 01-introduction
./start.sh
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
cd 01-introduction
.\start.ps1
```

Both scripts automatically load environment variables from the root `.env` file and will build the JARs if they don't exist.

> **Note:** If you prefer to build all modules manually before starting:
>
> **Bash:**
> ```bash
> cd ..  # Go to root directory
> mvn clean package -DskipTests
> ```
>
> **PowerShell:**
> ```powershell
> cd ..  # Go to root directory
> mvn clean package -DskipTests
> ```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

**To stop:**

**Bash:**
```bash
./stop.sh  # This module only
# Or
cd .. && ./stop-all.sh  # All modules
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\stop.ps1  # This module only
# Or
cd ..; .\stop-all.ps1  # All modules
```

## Using the Application

The application provides a web interface with two chat implementations side-by-side.

*Dashboard showing both Simple Chat (stateless) and Conversational Chat (stateful) options*

### Stateless Chat (Left Panel)

Try this first. Ask "My name is John" and then immediately ask "What's my name?" The model won't remember because each message is independent. This demonstrates the core problem with basic language model integration - no conversation context.

<img src="../../../translated_images/en/simple-chat-stateless-demo.13aeb3978eab3234.webp" alt="Stateless Chat Demo" width="800"/>

*AI doesn't remember your name from the previous message*

### Stateful Chat (Right Panel)

Now try the same sequence here. Ask "My name is John" and then "What's my name?" This time it remembers. The difference is MessageWindowChatMemory - it maintains conversation history and includes it with each request. This is how production conversational AI works.

<img src="../../../translated_images/en/conversational-chat-stateful-demo.e5be9822eb23ff59.webp" alt="Stateful Chat Demo" width="800"/>

*AI remembers your name from earlier in the conversation*

Both panels use the same GPT-5 model. The only difference is memory. This makes it clear what memory brings to your application and why it's essential for real use cases.
